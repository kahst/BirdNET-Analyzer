This repo contains BirdNET models and scripts for processing large amounts of audio data or single audio files.
This is the most advanced version of BirdNET for acoustic analyses and we will keep this repository up-to-date with new models and improved interfaces to enable scientists with no CS background to run the analysis.

Feel free to use BirdNET for your acoustic analyses and research.

## About

Developed by the [K. Lisa Yang Center for Conservation Bioacoustics](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/ccb/) at the [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home) in collaboration with [Chemnitz University of Technology](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/index.html.en).

Go to https://birdnet.cornell.edu to learn more about the project.

Want to use BirdNET to analyze a large dataset? Don't hesitate to contact us: ccb-birdnet@cornell.edu

**Have a question, remark, or feature request? Please start a new issue thread to let us know. Feel free to submit a pull request.**

## Usage guide

This document provides instructions for downloading and installing the GUI, and conducting some of the most common types of analyses. Within the document, a link is provided to download example sound files that can be used for practice.

## Projects map

We have created an interactive map of projects that use BirdNET. If you are working on a project that uses BirdNET, please let us know [here](https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Analyzer/issues/221) and we can add it to the map.

You can access the map here: [Open projects map](https://kahst.github.io/BirdNET-Analyzer/projects.html)

## Funding

This project is supported by Jake Holshuh (Cornell class of ´69) and The Arthur Vining Davis Foundations.
Our work in the K. Lisa Yang Center for Conservation Bioacoustics is made possible by the generosity of K. Lisa Yang to advance innovative conservation technologies to inspire and inform the conservation of wildlife and habitats.

The development of BirdNET is supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research through the project “BirdNET+” (FKZ 01|S22072).
The German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety contributes through the “DeepBirdDetect” project (FKZ 67KI31040E).
In addition, the Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt supports BirdNET through the project “RangerSound” (project 39263/01).

## Partners

BirdNET is a joint effort of partners from academia and industry.
Without these partnerships, this project would not have been possible.
Thank you!
