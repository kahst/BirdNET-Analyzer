You can find a list of previous versions here: https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Analyzer/tree/main/birdnet_analyzer/checkpoints[BirdNET-Analyzer Model Version History]

[discrete]
==== Species range model V2.4 - V2, Jan 2024

* updated species range model based on eBird data
* more accurate (spatial) species range prediction
* slightly increased long-tail distribution in the temporal resolution 
* see https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Analyzer/discussions/234[this discussion post] for more details

== Technical Details

Model V2.4 uses the following settings:

* 48 kHz sampling rate (we up- and downsample automatically and can deal with artifacts from lower sampling rates)
* we compute 2 mel spectrograms as input for the convolutional neural network:
** first one has fmin = 0 Hz and fmax = 3000; nfft = 2048; hop size = 278; 96 mel bins
** second one has fmin = 500 Hz and fmax = 15 kHz; nfft = 1024; hop size = 280; 96 mel bins
* both spectrograms have a final resolution of 96x511 pixels
* raw audio will be normalized between -1 and 1 before spectrogram conversion
* we use non-linear magnitude scaling as mentioned in http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2125/paper_181.pdf[Schlüter 2018]
* V2.4 uses an EfficienNetB0-like backbone with a final embedding size of 1024

----
+
Here are two example commands to run this BirdNET version:
+
[source,sh]
----
python3 -m birdnet_analyzer.analyze --i example/ --o example/ --slist example/ --min_conf 0.5 --threads 4

python3 -m birdnet_analyzer.analyze --i example/ --o example/ --lat 42.5 --lon -76.45 --week 4 --sensitivity 1.0
----
+
. Run `embeddings.py` to extract feature embeddings instead of class predictions.
Result file will contain timestamps and lists of float values representing the embedding for a particular 3-second segment.
Embeddings can be used for clustering or similarity analysis.
Here is an example:
+
[source,sh]
----
python3 -m birdnet_analyzer.embeddings --i example/ --o example/ --threads 4 --batchsize 16
----
+
Here's a complete list of all command line arguments:
+
----
--i, Path to input file or folder. If this is a file, --o needs to be a file too.
--o, Path to output file or folder. If this is a file, --i needs to be a file too.
--overlap, Overlap of prediction segments. Values in [0.0, 2.9]. Defaults to 0.0.
--threads, Number of CPU threads.
--batchsize, Number of samples to process at the same time. Defaults to 1.
--fmin and --fmax, Minimum and maximum frequency for bandpass filter. Defaults to 0 and 15000.
----
+
. After the analysis, run `segments.py` to extract short audio segments for species detections to verify results.
This way, it might be easier to review results instead of loading hundreds of result files manually.
+
Here's a complete list of all command line arguments:
+
----
--audio, Path to folder containing audio files.
--results, Path to folder containing result files.
--o, Output folder path for extracted segments.
--min_conf, Minimum confidence threshold. Values in [0.01, 0.99]. Defaults to 0.1.
--max_segments, Number of randomly extracted segments per species.
--seg_length, Length of extracted segments in seconds. Defaults to 3.0.
--threads, Number of CPU threads.
----
+
. When editing your own `species_list.txt` file, make sure to copy species names from the labels file of each model.
+
You can find label files in the checkpoints folder, e.g., `checkpoints/V2.3/BirdNET_GLOBAL_3K_V2.3_Labels.txt`.
+
Species names need to consist of `scientific name_common name` to be valid.
+
. You can generate a species list for a given location using `species.py` in case you need it for reference.
Here is an example:
+
[source,sh]
----
python3 -m birdnet_analyzer.species --o example/species_list.txt --lat 42.5 --lon -76.45 --week 4
----
+
Here's a complete list of all command line arguments:
+
----
--o, Path to output file or folder. If this is a folder, file will be named 'species_list.txt'.
--lat, Recording location latitude.
--lon, Recording location longitude.
--week, Week of the year when the recording was made. Values in [1, 48] (4 weeks per month). Set -1 for year-round species list.
--threshold, Occurrence frequency threshold. Defaults to 0.03.
--sortby, Sort species by occurrence frequency or alphabetically. Values in ['freq', 'alpha']. Defaults to 'freq'.
----
+
The year-round list may contain some species, that are not included in any list for a specific week. See https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Analyzer/issues/211 for more details.
. This is a very basic version of the analysis workflow, you might need to adjust it to your own needs.
. Please open an issue to ask for new features or to document unexpected behavior.
. I will keep models up to date and upload new checkpoints whenever there is an improvement in performance.
I will also provide quantized and pruned model files for distribution.

=== Usage (Docker)

Install docker for Ubuntu:

[source,sh]
----
sudo apt install docker.io
----

Build Docker container:

[source,sh]
----
sudo docker build -t birdnet .
----

NOTE: You need to run docker build again whenever you make changes to the script.

In order to pass a directory that contains your audio files to the docker file, you need to mount it inside the docker container with `-v /my/path:/mount/path` before you can run the container.

You can run the container for the provided example soundscapes with:

[source,sh]
----
sudo docker run -v $PWD/example:/audio birdnet analyze.py --i audio --o audio --slist audio
----

You can adjust the directory that contains your recordings by providing an absolute path:

[source,sh]
----
sudo docker run -v /path/to/your/audio/files:/audio birdnet analyze.py --i audio --o audio --slist audio
----

You can also mount more than one drive, e.g., if input and output folder should be different:

[source,sh]
----
sudo docker run -v /path/to/your/audio/files:/input -v /path/to/your/output/folder:/output birdnet analyze.py --i input --o output --slist input
----

See <<usage-cli,Usage (CLI) section>> above for more command line arguments, all of them will work with Docker version.

NOTE: If you like to specify a species list (which will be used as post-filter and needs to be named 'species_list.txt'), you need to put it into a folder that also has to be mounted.

=== Usage (Server)

You can host your own analysis service and API by launching the `server.py` script.
This will allow you to send files to this server, store submitted files, analyze them and send detection results back to a client.
This could be a local service, running on a desktop PC, or a remote server.
The API can be accessed locally or remotely through a browser or Python client (or any other client implementation).

. Install one additional package with `pip3 install bottle`.
. Start the server with `python3 -m birdnet_analyzer.server`.
You can also specify a host name or IP and port number, e.g., `python3 -m birdnet_analayzer.server --host localhost --port 8080`.
+
Here's a complete list of all command line arguments:
+
----
--host, Host name or IP address of API endpoint server. Defaults to '0.0.0.0'.
--port, Port of API endpoint server. Defaults to 8080.
--spath, Path to folder where uploaded files should be stored. Defaults to '/uploads'.
--threads, Number of CPU threads for analysis. Defaults to 4.
--locale, Locale for translated species common names. Values in ['af', 'de', 'it', ...] Defaults to 'en'.
----
+
NOTE: The server is single-threaded, so you'll need to start multiple instances for higher throughput.
This service is intented for short audio files (e.g., 1-10 seconds).
+
. Query the API with a client.
You can use the provided Python client or any other client implementation.
Request payload needs to be `multipart/form-data` with the following fields: `audio` for raw audio data as byte code, and `meta` for additional information on the audio file.
Take a look at our example client implementation in the `client.py` script.
+
This script will read an audio file, generate metadata from command line arguments and send it to the server.
The server will then analyze the audio file and send back the detection results which will be stored as a JSON file.
+
Here's a complete list of all command line arguments:
+
----
--host, Host name or IP address of API endpoint server.
--port, Port of API endpoint server.
--i, Path to file that should be analyzed.
--o, Path to result file. Leave blank to store with audio file.
--lat, Recording location latitude. Set -1 to ignore.
--lon, Recording location longitude. Set -1 to ignore.
--week, Week of the year when the recording was made. Values in [1, 48] (4 weeks per month). Set -1 for year-round species list.
--overlap, Overlap of prediction segments. Values in [0.0, 2.9]. Defaults to 0.0.
--sensitivity, Detection sensitivity; Higher values result in higher sensitivity. Values in [0.5, 1.5]. Defaults to 1.0.
--pmode, Score pooling mode. Values in ['avg', 'max']. Defaults to 'avg'.
--num_results, Number of results per request.
--sf_thresh, Minimum species occurrence frequency threshold for location filter. Values in [0.01, 0.99]. Defaults to 0.03.
--save, Define if files should be stored on server. Values in [True, False]. Defaults to False.
----
+
. Parse results from the server.
The server will send back a JSON response with the detection results.
The response also contains a `msg` field, indicating `success` or `error`.
Results consist of a sorted list of (species, score) tuples.
+
This is an example response:
+

[source,json]
----
{"msg": "success", "results": [["Poecile atricapillus_Black-capped Chickadee", 0.7889], ["Spinus tristis_American Goldfinch", 0.5028], ["Junco hyemalis_Dark-eyed Junco", 0.4943], ["Baeolophus bicolor_Tufted Titmouse", 0.4345], ["Haemorhous mexicanus_House Finch", 0.2301]]}
----
+
NOTE: Let us know if you have any questions, suggestions, or feature requests.
Also let us know when hosting an analysis service - we would love to give it a try.

=== Usage (GUI)

We provide a very basic GUI which lets you launch the analysis through a web interface.

.Web based GUI
image::https://tuc.cloud/index.php/s/QyBczrWXCrMoaRC/download/analyzer_gui.png[GUI screenshot]

. You need to install two additional packages in order to use the GUI with `pip3 install pywebview gradio`
. Launch the GUI with `python3 -m birdnet_analyzer.gui`.
. Set all folders and parameters, after that, click 'Analyze'.

== Training

You can train your own custom classifier on top of BirdNET.
This is useful if you want to detect species that are not included in the default species list.
You can also use this to train a classifier for a specific location or season.
All you need is a dataset of labeled audio files, organized in folders by species (we use folder names as labels).
*This also works for non-bird species, as long as you have a dataset of labeled audio files*.
Audio files will be resampled to 48 kHz and converted into 3-second segments (we will use the center 3-second segment if the file is longer, we will pad with random noise if the file is shorter).
We recommend using at least 100 audio files per species (although training also works with less data).
You can download a sample training data set https://drive.google.com/file/d/16hgka5aJ4U69ane9RQn_quVmgjVY2AY5[here].

. Collect training data and organize in folders based on species names.
. Species labels should be in the format `<scientific name>_<species common name>` (e.g., `Poecile atricapillus_Black-capped Chickadee`), but other formats work as well.
. It can be helpful to include a non-event class.
If you name a folder 'Noise', 'Background', 'Other' or 'Silence', it will be treated as a non-event class.
. Run the training script with `python3 train.py --i <path to training data folder> --o <path to trained classifier model output>`.
+
Here is a list of all command line arguments:
+
----
--i, Path to training data folder. Subfolder names are used as labels.
--o, Path to trained classifier model output.
--crop_mode, Crop mode for training data. Values in ['center', 'first', 'segments']. Defaults to 'center'.
--crop_overlap, Overlap of training data segments in seconds if crop_mode is 'segments'. Defaults to 0.
--epochs, Number of training epochs. Defaults to 50.
--batch_size, Batch size. Defaults to 32.
--val_split, Validation split ratio. Defaults to 0.2.
--learning_rate, Learning rate. Defaults to 0.001.
--hidden_units, Number of hidden units. Defaults to 0. If set to >0, a two-layer classifier is used.
--dropout, Dropout rate. Defaults to 0.
--mixup, Whether to use mixup for training.
--upsampling_ratio, Balance train data and upsample minority classes. Values between 0 and 1. Defaults to 0.
--upsampling_mode, Upsampling mode. Can be 'repeat', 'mean' or 'smote'. Defaults to 'repeat'.
--model_format, Model output format. Can be 'tflite', 'raven' or 'both'. Defaults to 'tflite'.
--model_save_mode, Model save mode. Can be 'replace' or 'append'. Defaults to 'replace'.
--cache_mode, Cache mode. Can be 'none', 'load' or 'save'. Defaults to 'none'.
--cache_file, Path to cache file. Defaults to 'train_cache.npz'.
--threads, Number of CPU threads.
--fmin and --fmax, Minimum and maximum frequency for bandpass filter. Defaults to 0 and 15000.
--autotune, Whether to use automatic hyperparameter tuning (this will execute multiple training runs to search for optimal hyperparameters).
--autotune_trials, Number of training runs for hyperparameter tuning. Defaults to 50.
--autotune_executions_per_trial, The number of times a training run with a set of hyperparameters is repeated. Defaults to 1.
----

**The script saves the trained classifier model based on the best validation loss achieved during training. This ensures that the model saved is optimized for performance according to the chosen metric.**

After training, you can use the custom trained classifier with the `--classifier` argument of the `analyze.py` script. If you want to use the custom classifier in Raven, make sure to set `--model_format raven`. 

NOTE: Adjusting hyperparameters (e.g., number of hidden units, learning rate, etc.) can have a big impact on the performance of the classifier.

We recommend trying different hyperparameter settings. If you want to automate this process, you can use the `--autotune` argument (in that case, make sure to install keras_tuner with `pip3 install keras-tuner`). 

Example usage (when downloading and unzipping the sample training data set):

[source,sh]
----
python3 -m birdnet_analyzer.train --i train_data/ --o checkpoints/custom/Custom_Classifier.tflite
python3 -m birdnet_analyzer.analyze --classifier checkpoints/custom/Custom_Classifier.tflite
----

NOTE: Setting a custom classifier will also set the new labels file.
Due to these custom labels, the location filter and locale will be disabled.

You can include negative samples for classes by prefixing the folder names with a '-' (e.g., `-Poecile atricapillus_Black-capped Chickadee`). Do this with samples that definitely do not contain the species. Negative samples will only be used for training and not for validation. Also keep in mind that negative samples will only be used when a corresponding folder with positive samples exists. Negative samples cannot be used for binary classification, instead include these samples in the non-event folder.

To train with multi-label data separate the class labels with commas in the folder names (e.g., `Poecile atricapillus_Black-capped Chickadee, Cardinalis cardinalis_Northern Cardinal`). This can also be combined with negative samples as described above. The validation split will be performed combination of classes, so you might want to ensure sufficient data for each combination of classes. When using multi-label data the upsampling mode will be limited to 'repeat'.

== Segment review

Please read the excellent paper from Connor M. Wood and Stefan Kahl: https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Uwta4wYAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=Uwta4wYAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C[Guidelines for appropriate use of BirdNET scores and other detector outputs].


The *Review* tab in the GUI is an implementation of the workflow described in the paper. It allows you to review the segments that were detected by BirdNET and to label the segments manually. This can help you to choose an appropriate threshold for your specific use case.

General workflow:

. Use the *Segments* tab in the GUI or the `segments.py` script to extract short audio segments for species detections.
. Open the *Review* tab in the GUI and select the parent directory containing the directories for all the species you want to review.
. Review the segments and manually check "positive" if the segment does contain target species or "negative" if it does not.

For each selected sample the logistic regression curve is fitted and the threshold is calculated. The threshold is the point where the logistic regression curve crosses the 0.5 line.

== GUI Language

The default language of the GUI is English, but you can change it to German, French, Chinese or Portuguese in the *Settings* tab of the GUI. If you want to contribute a translation to another language you, use the files inside the `lang` folder as a template. You can then send us the translated files or create a pull request.
To check your translation, place your file inside the `lang` folder and start the GUI, your language should now be available in the *Settings* tab. After selecting your language, you should restart the GUI to apply the changes.

We thank our collaborators for contributing translations:
