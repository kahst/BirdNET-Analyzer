BirdNET in R
============

We do also provide a BirdNET package for R, which allows you to analyze audio recordings directly in R.

**birdnetR** is geared towards providing a robust workflow for ecological data analysis in bioacoustic projects. 
While it covers essential functionalities, it doesnâ€™t include all the features found in BirdNET-Analyzer. 
Some features might only be available in the BirdNET Analyzer and not in this package.

.. note::
    Please note that birdnetR is under active development, so you might encounter changes that could affect your current workflow.
    We recommend checking for updates regularly.
