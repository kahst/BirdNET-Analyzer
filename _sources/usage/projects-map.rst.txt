Projects Map
============

We want to highlight the many use cases and great projects in bioacoustics and conservation that use BirdNET in their workflow. Therefore, we have created an interactive map showing the approximate locations of these projects and some additional information.

You can access the map here: `Open projects map <../projects.html>`_

We will update the map regularly and also work on the visual representation. **However, we need your help to add more projects to the map and keep the information accurate**.

There are three ways to contribute: you can submit a pull request with an additional entry in the `projects data <https://github.com/birdnet-team/BirdNET-Analyzer/blob/main/docs/assets/js/projects_data.js>`_ file, you can submit `this Google form <https://forms.gle/z5aydVaRB9op3Tem9>`_, or you can simply reply in this thread and provide the following information:

- Project name*
- Organization/project lead*
- Target species*
- Country
- Region/Location*
- Latitude*
- Longitude*
- Contact
- Website
- Paper
- Species Image URL
- Species Image Credit

The fields marked with an asterisk are required to place a valid mark on the map.

If you would like to update a project or find that some information is incorrect, please reply to this thread as well.
