Introduction
------------

BirdNET-Analyzer is an open source tool for analyzing bird calls using machine learning models. It can process large amounts of audio recordings and identify (bird) species based on their calls.

Get started by listening to this AI-generated introduction of the BirdNET-Analyzer:
