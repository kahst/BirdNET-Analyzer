Installation
============

Raven Pro
---------

If you want to analyze audio files without any additional coding or package install, you can now use `Raven Pro software <https://ravensoundsoftware.com/software/raven-pro/>`_ to run BirdNET models.
After download, BirdNET is available through the new "Learning detector" feature in Raven Pro.
| For more information on how to use this feature, please visit the `Raven Pro Knowledge Base <https://ravensoundsoftware.com/article-categories/learning-detector/>`_.

`Download the newest model version here <https://tuc.cloud/index.php/s/2TX59Qda2X92Ppr/download/BirdNET_GLOBAL_6K_V2.4_Model_Raven.zip>`_, extract the zip-file and move the extracted folder to the Raven models folder. On Windows, the models folder is `C:\\Users\\<Your user name>\\Raven Pro 1.6\\Models`. Start Raven Pro and select *BirdNET_GLOBAL_6K_V2.4_Model_Raven* as learning detector.

Python Package
--------------

The easiest way to setup BirdNET on your machine is to install `birdnetlib <https://joeweiss.github.io/birdnetlib/>`_ or `birdnet <https://pypi.org/project/birdnet/>`_ through pip with:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install birdnetlib
or

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install birdnet

Please take a look at the `birdnetlib user guide <https://joeweiss.github.io/birdnetlib/#using-birdnet-analyzer>`_ on how to analyze audio with `birdnetlib`. 

When using the `birdnet`-package, you can run BirdNET with:

.. code-block:: python
    from pathlib import Path
    from birdnet.models import ModelV2M4

    # create model instance for v2.4
    model = ModelV2M4()

    # predict species within the whole audio file
    species_in_area = model.predict_species_at_location_and_time(42.5, -76.45, week=4)
    predictions = model.predict_species_within_audio_file(
        Path("soundscape.wav"),
        filter_species=set(species_in_area.keys())
    )

    # get most probable prediction at time interval 0s-3s
    prediction, confidence = list(predictions[(0.0, 3.0)].items())[0]
    print(f"predicted '{prediction}' with a confidence of {confidence:.6f}")
    # predicted 'Poecile atricapillus_Black-capped Chickadee' with a confidence of 0.814056
